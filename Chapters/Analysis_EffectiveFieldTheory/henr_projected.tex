In addition to these backgrounds it is important to note several which have been omitted: namely $\gamma$-X and ${}^{83m}$Kr.
Also missing accidental and wall based.

\subsection{$\gamma$-X}
It is possible for light-to-charge ration of an S1-S2 pulse pair to be attenuated, causing an ER event to appear NR-like.
For this S2-suppression, a $\gamma$-ray needs to scatter in two separate regions of the TPC, one where ionisation electrons are detected, and one where they are not.
In this case, a single S1 will be detected (due to how close in time the scatters are), and a single S2.
There are two significant locations where these events can originate: in the reverse field region (RFR) of the TPC and the walls of the TPC.
\par
These events have not been included here due to the need to include additional parameters in order to adequately model them: namely the position of the event needs to be taken into account.
It should be noted that it is also possible to cut out these events using a tighter fiducial cut, but this directly impacts exposure.
In future searches, LZ is planning on using a boosted decision tree machine learning technique that is based upon LUX Run-4 EFT analysis \cite{LUX_RUN4_EFT_2021}.
