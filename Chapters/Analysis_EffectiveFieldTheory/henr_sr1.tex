\section{Results from First Science Run}
\par
In this section, limits are placed on the elastic EFT operator couplings using data from the first science run (SR1) of LZ.
The region of interest considered here is limited to $\backsim$30 keV, i.e. 80 phd, rather than an extended energy window used in the previous section.
A more complete analysis using an extended recoil energy range is currently under preparation.
An analysis for SI and SD dark matter interactions have already been performed in this recoil energy range, with null results \cite{lz_ws_sr1_ref}.
As the analysis presented here uses the same dataset and cuts only a limited summary of SR1 is presented here.
An overview of the calibration sources used for SR1 is described in \autoref{sec:lz_calibrations}.
A more complete description of the backgrounds in SR1 is laid out in \cite{lz_sr1_backgrounds_ref}.

\subsection{Overview of SR1}
\par
SR1 ran for a total of 116 days from 23 December 2021 to 18 April 2022 during which time the detector was in a stable running state.
As was mentioned in \autoref{sec:od_analysis_backgrounds}, several interruptions occurred for both calibration runs and system maintenance reducing the data set down to 89 live days.
The length of time running was driven by a requirement to demonstrate physics capability and so only ran until the sensitivity to SI interactions was comparable to previous experiments.
SR1 was primarily an engineering run, and as such, no blinding or salting of the data set was performed.
As with any new detector, there are unexpected features that are best understood by being able to see and explore them.
In order to mitigate bias in analysis development, analysis cuts were developed in side bands and from calibration data.

\subsection{TPC Calibration}
\par
The spatial variation in $S1$ and $S2$ was corrected using primarily internal sources which are naturally dispersed throughout the detector volume.
${}^{83m}$Kr and ${}^{131m}$Xe were used for this along with injected tritium (injected as tritiated methane CH$_3$T).
Energy calibrations were performed with the internal sources as well as ${}^{129m}$Xe, which is monoenergetic at higher energies outside of the region considered here.
$g_1$ was determined to be 0.114$\pm$0.002 phd/photon and $g_2$ as 47.1$\pm$1.1 phd/electron \cite{lz_ws_sr1_ref}.
The size of a single electron light signal was measured as 57.6$\pm$1.9 phd/electron which gives an electron extraction efficiency of 80.5$\pm$3.7\% \cite{lz_ws_sr1_ref}.
For calibrating the detector model, NR events were produced produced using the DD neutrons and AmLi, whilst ER events were produced using tritium.
The detector response model was tuned to these measurements which are shown in \autoref{fig:sr1_tpc_calibration} along with the ER and NR bands.

\subsection{Analysis Cuts}
\par
In addition to the core-cuts that remove scatters that are inconsistent with dark matter that have been previously discussed, a multitude of other cuts were developed.
They fall broadly into three categories: live time, S2-based cuts and S1-based cuts.
These three, along with the core cuts are briefly discussed below.


\subsubsection{Live Time Cuts}
The live time cuts are named as such as they have a large adverse affect on the amount of data available.
Data is removed which shows uncharacteristic behaviour in the form of a high rate of pulses.
The two most significant cuts were an electron-train cut and a hot spot cut, together removing 35\% of the livetime.
After a large S2 event, a period of a sustained high rate is observed. 
This is due to electrons attaching to impurities and then being released at some later time, causing a delayed extraction and an elevated rate after the S2.
Single photons are also observed after the same event which is thought to be from delayed fluorescence.
The removal of time after an S2 until the detector rate settles corresponds to 29.8\% of live day loss.
Occasionally hot spots appeared in the TPC due to electron emission from the grids. 
These periods of time lasted approximately an hour at a time and reduced the live time by 6.6\%.
There were several other cuts in this category which combined reduced livetime by a further 1\%.

\subsubsection{S2 cuts}
A suite of cuts were developed to remove S2s which did not look like an S2 should if it had originated from a LXe scatter.
These targeted accidental events.

\subsubsection{S1 cuts}


developed a hot spot where 

\subsubsection{Core cuts}
All of these core cuts focus on removing clean scatters in the TPC, but which do not match the properties of dark matter.
Only events with a single S1-S2 pulse pair are selected, multiple S1 or multiple S2 events are removed.
\par
The fiducial region was defined in $z$ by the drift time (time between the S1 and S2 pulses) of between [86,936.5] $\mu$s which corresponds to approximately 12.8 cm below the gate grid and 2.2 cm from the cathode grid.
$r$ was defined as either [4.0,5.0,5.2] cm from the TPC wall. The variation in the $r$ is to remove regions where the electric field is non-uniform, and effects from being close to the wall.
Within this region a the volume of xenon is 5.5$\pm$0.2 tonnes.
%\autoref{fig:sr1_fiducial_cut} shows the fiducial volume definition.
\par
The region of interest was defined as 3 phd $<$ S1$_c <$ 80 phd, S2 $>$ 600 phd and S2$_c <$ 10$^5$ phd.
\par
The OD veto window was set to the value discussed in the previous chapter of 1200 $\mu$s, with an energy threshold of 200 keV.
The Skin veto window was set to 400 $\mu$s.
Additionally a prompt veto window was implemented to remove events where the S1 is within [-300,300] ns of a pulse in either the Skin or OD.

\par
The combined efficiency of all of these cuts is shown in \autoref{fig:sr1_nr_efficiency}.
A total of 335 events remained after the application of all of these cuts which are shown in \autoref{fig:henr_ws_sr1_events}.

\subsection{Background Model}
\par
In the background model, 9 components were included.
The grouping is based upon the distribution in the ROI and the level of uncertainty.

\par
The ${}^{222}$Rn chain and ${}^{220}$Rn chain both produce flat $\beta$ contributions in this region.
The rate of these contributions was determined from $\alpha$-peak fitting to the ER band outside of the ROI which can be seen in \autoref{fig:sr1_spectra}.
The $\gamma$ spectrum from the detector contaminants is also flat in this region and is constrained from the radioassay \cite{LZ_assay_ref}.
These contributions are treated as a single background labelled \textit{Flat ER} in subsequent plots.
This is the largest contribution to the expected rate, with 218 $\pm$ 36 events.
\par
Two contributes which were ignored in the projected sensitivity have been included here: ${}^{127}$Xe and ${}^{37}$Ar.
As previously discussed, these have half-lives of approximate a month each, the contribution during SR1 cannot be ignored.
Both components originate from cosmic activation of xenon and so the amount of each in the TPC depends upon how long the xenon spent above ground prior to being moved underground.
The contribution from $^{127}$Xe was constrained by sideband analysis from K-shell x-rays deexcitation \cite{marisarthurs_thesis_ref}.
${}^{37}$Ar cannot be constrained by sideband analysis as its decays are within the ROI.
However the contribution can be constrained by the delivery schedule of the xenon \cite{lz_argon37_ref}.
This put the expected count to be $\approx$100 in this data set but there a very large uncertainty meaning that it could be has high at 300.
In the PLR, ${}^{37}$Ar was allowed to float from anywhere between 0 and 291 events.
\par
Two other xenon isotopes were considered ${}^{124}$Xe and ${}^{136}$Xe, both of which are constrained by the mass of xenon \cite{lz_ws_sr1_ref}.
\par
Accidental events, where unrelated S1 and S2 pulses are produced in an event window were also included.
The rate of this was data driven by selecting unphysical single scatter events, based upon electron drift time.
\par
Two contributions to NR events were considered: neutrinos and detector components.
The contribution from NR neutrinos is limited due to the S2$>$600 phd requirement.
Only ${}^{8}$B neutrinos were considered \cite{lz_ws_sr1_ref}.
The rate of neutrons from detector components is constrained by the radioassay and by the number of events which are vetoed by the OD \cite{lz_sr1_backgrounds_ref}.

\subsection{Limits}
\par
On each operator for WIMP masses of [5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 21, 33, 50, 100, 200, 400, 1000, 4000] GeV/c$^2$, a 2-sided frequentist confidence interval is determined above a 90\% confidence level.
Shown in \autoref{tab:sr1_ws_lz_backgrounds} are the constraints and final fit values (from a background-only hypothesis) of the nuisance parameters in this analysis.
This is supported by \autoref{fig:henr_ws_sr1_fitted_events}, which shows the final dataset along with the likelihood of of each point being part of any given background component.
Many data points are made up of more than one colour.
This indicates that the background component PDFs overlap.
Each data point is well modelled by the backgrounds considered.

\par
Although several data points are within the NR band, a background only model was found to preferable, with zero signal events being the best fit for all masses and operators.
This is consistent with the SI and SD searches \cite{lz_ws_sr1_ref}.
These events are leakage from the ER band.
Presented in \autoref{fig:EFT_Result_SR1_Sensitivity_1} and \autoref{fig:EFT_Result_SR1_Sensitivity_2} are the upper limits, presented in the same dimensionless form as the projected limits.
Shown also are the limits from both Xenon100 \cite{xenon100_eft_ref} and LUX \cite{LUX_RUN4_EFT_2021}.
World-leading sensitivity has been achieved for all operators at at least some masses.
In several cases, such as $\Operator$6 the sensitivity of LZ is less than that of both LUX and XENON100. 
This is due to the recoil distributions of these operators peaking outside of the ROI used here for high WIMP masses.
Despite this reduced parameter space, the huge increase in exposure has made LZ very competitive.


\par
LZ is in a very good state, able to demonstrate world leading sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon scattering.
With a planned exposure 17$\times$ larger than SR1, and additional observable in the PLR, the discovery potential of LZ is 
Within SR1 there is still interesting studies to be done, with the expansion of the region of interest to include more of each signal model to either set tighter constraints or an excess of events.
