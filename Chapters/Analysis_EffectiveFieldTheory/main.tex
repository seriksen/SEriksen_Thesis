\chapter{Analysis of Effective Field Theory Interactions in LZ}
\label{chap:analysis_eft_work}
In this final analysis chapter, two studies are performed using the model independent dark matter approach from \autoref{chap:detection_theory}.
The first is a projected sensitivity of LZ to EFT signals.
The second is an analysis of the first science run (SR1).
\par
Both studies were performed on EFT operators in the isoscalar basis, setting limits (projected and real) by hypothesis testing with a profile likelihood ratio (PLR).
The same signal model generation framework was used for each.
These two features are explained prior to the individual studies.

%\par
%To re-emphasise what was said in \autoref{chapter:lz_outer_detector}, in order to perform any each for a rare events (in our case nuclear recoils) you need to understand the discrimination between ER and NR events, and you need a detailed understanding of backgrounds.
%In both studies a background discussion is included, explaining why each background was considered.
