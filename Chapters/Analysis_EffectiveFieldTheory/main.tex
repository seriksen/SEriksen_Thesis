\chapter{Analysis of Effective Field Theory Interactions in LZ}
\label{chap:analysis_eft_work}
In this final analysis chapter, two studies are performed using the elastic EFT operators introduced in \autoref{chap:detection_theory}.
The first is a projected sensitivity of LZ, based upon a 1000 live day exposure, referred to as full exposure in this chapter.
The second is an analysis of the first science run (SR1), with 60 live days.
\par
Both studies were performed on isoscalar EFT operators using hypothesis testing with a profile likelihood ratio (PLR).
The same statistical methodology and signal model generation framework was used for each study.
These are explained prior to the individual studies.

%\par
%To re-emphasise what was said in \autoref{chapter:lz_outer_detector}, in order to perform any each for a rare events (in our case nuclear recoils) you need to understand the discrimination between ER and NR events, and you need a detailed understanding of backgrounds.
%In both studies a background discussion is included, explaining why each background was considered.
