\chapter{Analysis of Effective Field Theory Interactions in LZ}
\label{chap:eft_work}
In this final analysis chapter we pull together many of the concepts touched on in this Thesis to perform a dark matter search, and ultimately setting limits on the each of the 
We use our model independent approach from \autoref{chap:detection_theory} along with the PLR in CHAPTER XXX

\par
To re-emphasise what was said in CHAPTER XXX, in order to perform any each for a rare events (in our case nuclear recoils) you need to understand the discrimination between ER and NR events, and you need a detailed understanding of backgrounds.

For SR1 fewer parameters were taken into consideration with the PLR working in [S1,logS2] space.
Increasing the set of parameters will allow for improved discrimination and a potential discovery but runs into significant computational limitations as discovered in both \cite{nicolelarsen_thesis_ref, shaunalsum_thesis_ref, billyboxer_thesis_ref}, a different approach such as that described in \cite{flamenest_ref} and \cite{lux_ml_plr_ref} offer some hope for this.
