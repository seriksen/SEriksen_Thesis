\chapter{Analysis of Effective Field Theory Interactions in LZ}
\label{chap:eft_work}
Using the EFT principles which were outlines in \autoref{sec:eft_theory} In this chapter an EFT

We use our model independent approach from \autoref{chap:detection_theory} along with the PLR in CHAPTER XXX

This chapter contains two studies, a projected sensitivity of LZ to EFT signals and an analysis on the first science run.
Each of these studies

\par
To re-emphasise what was said in \autoref{chapter:lz_outer_detector}, in order to perform any each for a rare events (in our case nuclear recoils) you need to understand the discrimination between ER and NR events, and you need a detailed understanding of backgrounds.
In both studies a background discussion is included, explaining why each background was considered.
