For SR1 fewer parameters were taken into consideration with the PLR working in [S1,logS2] space.
Increasing the set of parameters will allow for improved discrimination and a potential discovery but runs into significant computational limitations as discovered in both \cite{nicolelarsen_thesis_ref, shaunalsum_thesis_ref, billyboxer_thesis_ref}, a different approach such as that described in \cite{flamenest_ref} and \cite{lux_ml_plr_ref} offer some hope for this.
