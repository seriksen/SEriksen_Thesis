A frequentist hypothesis test is most typically used in which there are two well defined hypotheses.


In this chapter the statistical statistical technique used by the LZ collaboration is explained.
A detailed explanation of the coding framework can be found in \cite{LZ_Ibles_LZStats_Thesis_ref}.

In the projected study the test is summarised as:
"finding the value $\mu$ above which the background plus signal model is incompatible with a background only model.
