\chapter{Analysis of the Outer Detector} \label{chap:analysis_of_the_od}

\par
In this chapter, the calibration of the OD, once it was constructed is described, which sets the foundations for assessing if the requirements set out in \autoref{tab:veto_requirements} are achieved.
These requirements are: that the neutron veto efficiency is at least 95\%, and that no more than 5\% of the WIMP search time is vetoed.
\par
For ascertaining an appropriate veto window, a study on the OD backgrounds is performed. 
This is followed by the results from a neutron calibration.
Together these provide the assessment of the performance.
\par
Finally a particle discrimination method is suggested, which in future may allow for the OD to be used as a more intelligent veto.
