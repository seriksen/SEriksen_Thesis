\section{Cavern $\gamma$ Generator}
\label{sec:cavern_gamma_generator}

\par
Although the LZ detector has been constructed underground to limit cosmic radiation, it does come with the drawback of being in a mine which is itself a source of $\gamma$ radiation.
LZ is not unique in this, it is a problem highlighted in a number of other underground experiments \cite{cavern_gamma_annual_modulation_CoGeNT_ref, cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}, with an annual modulation mimicking dark matter potentially, noticed in \cite{cavern_gamma_annual_modulation_CoGeNT_ref}.
The rate of $\gamma$s from the cavern has been measured and can be attributed to the shotcrete and gravel which are in the Davis Cavern in which LZ is located \cite{LZ_Gamma_Ray_Background_ref}.
The $\gamma$s which were measured are from $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th and $^{40}$K decays.
These decay chains are discussed in \autoref{chapter:lz_outer_detector} and can be seen in \autoref{fig:decay_chains}.
The rate of each of these decay chain which was measured in \cite{LZ_Gamma_Ray_Background_ref} are shown in \autoref{tab:cavern_gamma_generator_parameters}.
Each of the decay chains have an uncertainty of more than 50\%.
\par
It is very computationally intensive to simulate these $\gamma$-rays as the vast majority do not reach the detectors.
To compensate, a generator for these $\gamma$s was written - originally described in \cite{rg_generator_ref} and is summarised below.
The generator simulates the decay chains originating in the shotcrete and gravel, but only contains $\gamma$s, which have reached a pre-defined inner surface within the LZ experiment.
To create this generator, a number of simulations are performed in stages.
In the first stage, $\gamma$s from the cavern wall are simulated and propagated until they reach a surface closer to the detector, at which point they are saved, and the simulation stopped.
A second stage simulation is then performed where each of the saved $\gamma$s is generated a number of times and then saved at another pre-defined surface further into the detector.
This boost occurs a number of times until the final stage, where the $\gamma$s which reach that surface are saved for use in future event generation.
When subsequent simulations are performed, these saved $\gamma$s are randomly sampled. 

\par
This simulation considers additional geometry which is outside of the LZ water tank.
These include a steel pyramid and gravel below the water tank, a steel plate above the water tank, and the cavern rock.
The simulation geometry is shown in \autoref{fig:Cavern_Geometry}.

\par
A generator for these cavern $\gamma$s has existed for some time \cite{rg_generator_ref}, but it has a number of flaws.
Firstly, no $\gamma$s below 2 MeV were included.
This meant that $^{40}K$ was not included and there was a bias to higher energy events and therefore a higher rate.
The previous generator was created using a GEANT4.9.5 while the rest of the simulation chain had moved on to GEANT4.10.3.p02. 
Finally, significant portions of the detector geometry had been updated to reflect more closely the final design. 
This motivated the creation of an updated generator.

\par
The parameters of the new generator are shown in \autoref{tab:cavern_gamma_generator_parameters}, and a comparison of the energy distribution of the old and new generators is shown in \autoref{fig:cavern_gamma_energy_distribution}.
$^{40}$K was not included in the previous generator as all $\gamma$s are below 2 MeV.
The previous generator also had a maximum $\gamma$ energy of 10 MeV.
Above 9 MeV, there is an increase in the rate, which is from changes introduced between GEANT4.9.5 and GEANT4.10.3.p02.
These $\gamma$s are predominately from ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) reactions such as ${}^{17}$O$ + \alpha \to {}^{20}$Ne$ + \gamma$, where a decay $\alpha$ is captured by a nucleus in the rock.
As these higher energy $\gamma$s are able to travel further into the detector they are more likely to reach the TPC.
Conversely, they may produce large signals in the OD which would trigger a veto, reducing the detector livetime.
Since GEANT4.10.3.p02, there have been new studies of the ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) cross-section in other underground laboratories, such as in \cite{cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}.
Generally, very little attention has been given to ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) rates, and so it is possible that the observed rate may differ significantly from that shown here. 
In \autoref{fig:cavern_gamma_energy_distribution} the largest difference is at high energies, as was shown in the Sudan Mine \cite{cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}, the rate of sub-6MeV $\gamma$s may also change significantly. 
There is however evidence that the cross-sections used by GEANT4 - which uses the statistical method from TALYS \cite{talys_ref} - has a large uncertainty for ${}^{17}$O$ + \alpha \to {}^{20}$Ne$ + n$ \cite{alpha_gamma_statistical_error_ref}.
It has been suggested that the rate of $\gamma$'s above 2 MeV from ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) reactions being 5 orders of magnitude higher than expected in GEANT4 simulations \cite{soudanmine_counter_point_ref, alpha_gamma_reactions_ref}.
This is explored on LZ data in \autoref{sec:od_analysis_backgrounds}.

\par
The livetime ($l$) for a simulation can be determined then by $l_{\text{simulation}} = \frac{\text{n.} \gamma_{\text{simulated}}}{\text{n.} \gamma_{\text{generator}}} * \text{l}_{\text{generator}}$
In short, this means that every $\gamma$ in the generator represents roughly 130000 decays from the rock, and so is a significant computational saving on repeated simulations.

During the comparison between the two generator versions, it was noticed that the previous generator had not been created correctly.
This caused a bias in the $\gamma$ distribution to the top of the detector, as the generator surface did not cover the sides of the detector adequately.
The most significant effect on this would have been in any dark matter sensitivity study, such as \cite{lz_simulations_ref}, where the fiducial volume may have had to of changed size if external $\gamma$ events were originating from other locations.
The discovery of this was made possible by the geometry visualisation that the author pioneered within the LZ collaboration.

\par
The energy deposit distribution from simulations using the updated generator is shown in \autoref{fig:cavern_gamma_position_distribution}.
The most significant contribution to the rate is in the bottom of the Outer Detector side tanks, and events which enter the TPC enter from the sides as well as the top and bottom\footnote{In the previous generator $\gamma$ would only enter the TPC from the top.}.
