\section{Cavern $\gamma$ Generator}
\label{sec:cavern_gamma_generator}

\par
Although the LZ detector has been constructed underground to limit cosmic radiation, it does come with a drawback of being in a mine with a non-negligibly radioactive rock and the shotcreat and gravel within the David Cavern.
LZ is not unique in this, it is a problem highlighted in a number of other underground experiments \cite{cavern_gamma_annual_modulation_CoGeNT_ref, cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}, with an annual modulation mimicking dark matter potentially seen in \cite{cavern_gamma_annual_modulation_CoGeNT_ref}.
The rate of this has been measured and can be attributed to the shotcreat and gravel \cite{LZ_Gamma_Ray_Background_ref} - though the rate had a significant uncertainty.
One of the most significant sources of background come not from any internal component but rather from $^{238}U$, $^{232}Th$ and $^{40}K$ decays from the cavern in which the LZ detector exists (The decay chains for which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:decay_chains}).
However, this is a computationally intensive process to simulation $\gamma$'s where the majority will not reach the actual detector.
To compensate, a generator for these $\gamma$'s was created - and originally described in \cite{rg_generator_ref} but summarised below.
The generator is a created by performing simulations of the decay chains originating in the shotcreat and gravel.
The $\gamma$'s which reach a pre-defined surface are saved.
A second stage simulation is then performed where each of the saved $\gamma$'s is generated a number of times and then saved at another pre-defined surface.
This boost occurs a number of times, until the final stage where the $\gamma$'s which reach that surface are used in the generator.
When subsequent simulations are performed, these saved $\gamma$'s are randomly sampled. 

\par
For the creation of the generator additional cavern properties are added to the simulation.
Namely; a steel pyramid and gravel beneath the water tank, and a layer of shotcreat.
These adaptions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Cavern_Geometry}.

Although as mentioned in \cite{lz_simulations_ref}, a generator for the Davis Cavern $\gamma$'s existed, it had a number of flaws.
Firstly, no $\gamma$ below 2MeV were included.
This meant that $^{40}K$ was not included and there was a bias to higher energy events and therefore a higher rate.
Additionally, the generator was created using a version of GEANT4 which the rest of the simulation chain had moved on from; GEANT4.9.5 to GEANT4.10.3.p02. 
This motivated the creation of a new generator.

\par
The parameters of the new generator are shown in Table \ref{tab:cavern_gamma_generator_parameters} and a comparison of the energy distribution of the old and new generators is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cavern_gamma_energy_distribution}.
Although it can be seen that the previous generators had a maximum $\gamma$ energy of 10MeV, it also highlights a significant change between GEANT4.9.5 and GEANT4.10.3.p02.
That is, an increased rate above 9MeV.
These $\gamma$'s are predominately from ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) reactions such as $O + \alpha \to Ne + \gamma$.
These are of particular concern as they have the potential to mimic dark matter.
Conversely, they may produce large signals in the OD which would trigger a veto, reducing the detector livetime.
Since this version of GEANT4, there have been new studies of the ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) cross-section in other underground laboratories, such as in \cite{cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}.
Generally, very little attention has been given to ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) rates, and so it is possible that the observed rate may differ significantly from that shown here as although in Figure \ref{fig:cavern_gamma_energy_distribution} the largest difference is at higher energy $\gamma$'s, as was shown in the Sudan Mine \cite{cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}, the rate of sub-6MeV $\gamma$'s may also change significantly. 

\par
The livetime ($l$) for a simulation can be determined then by $l_{\text{simulation}} = \frac{\text{n.} \gamma_{\text{simulated}}}{\text{n.} \gamma_{\text{generator}}} * \text{l}_{\text{generator}}$
In short, this means that every $\gamma$ in the generator represents roughly 130000 decays from the rock, and so is a significant computational saving.

Additionally it was noticed during the comparison that in the previous generator the distribution was not a cylinder but rather had mistakenly been created as a table.
The result of this is that the $\gamma$ distribution is biased to the top and bottom of the detectors more so than it would otherwise be.
The energy deposit distribution from the newly created generator is shown in Figures \ref{fig:cavern_gamma_position_distribution}.
