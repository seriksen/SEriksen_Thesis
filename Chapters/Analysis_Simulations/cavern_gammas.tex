\section{Cavern $\gamma$ Generator}
\label{sec:cavern_gamma_generator}

\par
Although the LZ detector has been constructed underground to limit cosmic radiation, it does come with a drawback of being in a mine with a non-negligibly radioactive rock and the shotcreat and gravel within the Davis Cavern.
LZ is not unique in this, it is a problem highlighted in a number of other underground experiments \cite{cavern_gamma_annual_modulation_CoGeNT_ref, cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}, with an annual modulation mimicking dark matter potentially, noticed in \cite{cavern_gamma_annual_modulation_CoGeNT_ref}.
The rate of this has been measured and can be attributed to the shotcreat and gravel \cite{LZ_Gamma_Ray_Background_ref} - though the rate had a significant uncertainty.
One of the most significant sources of background come not from any internal component but rather from $^{238}U$, $^{232}Th$ and $^{40}K$ decays from the cavern in which the LZ detector exists (The decay chains for which can be seen in \autoref{fig:decay_chains}).
However, this is a computationally intensive process to simulation $\gamma$'s where the majority will not reach the actual detector.
To compensate, a generator for these $\gamma$'s was created - and originally described in \cite{rg_generator_ref} but summarised below.
The generator is created by performing simulations of the decay chains originating in the shotcreat and gravel.
The $\gamma$'s which reach a pre-defined surface are saved.
A second stage simulation is then performed where each of the saved $\gamma$'s is generated a number of times and then saved at another pre-defined surface.
This boost occurs a number of times, until the final stage where the $\gamma$'s which reach that surface are used in the generator.
When subsequent simulations are performed, these saved $\gamma$'s are randomly sampled. 

\par
For the creation of the generator additional cavern properties are added to the simulation.
Namely; a steel pyramid and gravel beneath the water tank, and a layer of shotcreat.
These adaptions are shown in \autoref{fig:Cavern_Geometry}.

Although as mentioned in \cite{lz_simulations_ref}, a generator for the Davis Cavern $\gamma$'s existed, it had a number of flaws.
Firstly, no $\gamma$ below 2MeV were included.
This meant that $^{40}K$ was not included and there was a bias to higher energy events and therefore a higher rate.
Additionally, the generator was created using a version of GEANT4 while the rest of the simulation chain had moved on from GEANT4.9.5 to GEANT4.10.3.p02. 
This motivated the creation of a new generator.

\par
The parameters of the new generator are shown in \autoref{tab:cavern_gamma_generator_parameters} and a comparison of the energy distribution of the old and new generators is shown in \autoref{fig:cavern_gamma_energy_distribution}.
Although it can be seen that the previous generators had a maximum $\gamma$ energy of 10MeV, it also highlights a significant change between GEANT4.9.5 and GEANT4.10.3.p02.
That is, an increased rate above 9MeV.
These $\gamma$'s are predominately from ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) reactions such as $O + \alpha \to Ne + \gamma$, where a decay $\alpha$ is captured by a nucleus in the rock.
As these higher energy $\gamma$'s are able to travel further into the detector they are more able to reach the TPC - mimicking dark matter.
Conversely, they may produce large signals in the OD which would trigger a veto, reducing the detector livetime.
Since this version of GEANT4, there have been new studies of the ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) cross-section in other underground laboratories, such as in \cite{cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}.
Generally, very little attention has been given to ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) rates, and so it is possible that the observed rate may differ significantly from that shown here as although in \autoref{fig:cavern_gamma_energy_distribution} the largest difference is at higher energy $\gamma$'s, as was shown in the Sudan Mine \cite{cavern_gammas_in_Soudan_mine_ref}, the rate of sub-6MeV $\gamma$'s may also change significantly. 
There is however evidence that the cross-sections used by Geant4 - which uses the statistical method from TALYS \cite{talys_ref} - has a large uncertainty for ${O}^{17} + \alpha \to {Ne}^{20} + n$ \cite{alpha_gamma_statistical_error_ref}.
Given this, it has been suggested that the rate of $\gamma$'s above 2MeV from ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) reactions being 5 orders of magnitude higher than expected \cite{soudanmine_counter_point_ref, alpha_gamma_reactions_ref}.
This is explored on LZ data in \autoref{sec:od_analysis_backgrounds}.

\par
The livetime ($l$) for a simulation can be determined then by $l_{\text{simulation}} = \frac{\text{n.} \gamma_{\text{simulated}}}{\text{n.} \gamma_{\text{generator}}} * \text{l}_{\text{generator}}$
In short, this means that every $\gamma$ in the generator represents roughly 130000 decays from the rock, and so is a significant computational saving.

Additionally it was noticed during the comparison that in the previous generator that it had not been created correctly.
This caused a bias in the $\gamma$ distribution to the top of the detector.
The energy deposit distribution from the newly created generator is shown in \autoref{fig:cavern_gamma_position_distribution}, where the most significant contribution to rate is in the bottom of the Outer Detector side tanks.
