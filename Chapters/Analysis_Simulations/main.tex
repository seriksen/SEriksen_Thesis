\par
In this chapter, important contributions to the development of the LZ simulation capabilities are described.
All of the contributions are specifically for BACCARAT (described in the previous chapter).
These include updates to a light map for S2 photons, as well as early development work to migrate a subset of simulations onto graphics card processors.
Finally updates to a background particle generator are discussed which is used in subsequent chapters.
