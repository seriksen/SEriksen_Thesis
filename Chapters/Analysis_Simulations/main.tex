\par
In this chapter, important contributions to the development of the LZ simulation capabilities are described.
All the contributions are specifically for BACCARAT (described in the previous chapter).
These include updates to a light map for S2 photons and early development work to migrate a subset of simulations onto graphics card processors.
Finally, updates to a background particle generator are discussed, which is used in subsequent chapters.

\subsubsection*{Summary}
\par
In this chapter three simulation contributions are described.
It started with an explanation of the S2 Light Map, a probabilistic approach to speed up optical photon simulations.
This was followed by the implementation of LZ geometry within Opticks, GPU simulation framework, which allows for every photon to be simulated.
A speed improvement of more than 700x was demonstrated when compared to CPU simulations.
Finally a background generator for cavern-$\gamma$s was described.
