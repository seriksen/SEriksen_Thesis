\section{Effective Field Theory} \label{eft_theory}

\par
The limits (and possible discoveries) which each direct detection dark matter experiment aim for are generally placed on the simplest possible interaction between an WIMP and a nucleon, as described in the previous section.
The assumption of a momentum-independent interactions is assumed due to the non-relativistic velocity of the WIMP.
The kinematics of the interaction do not have to follow this, instead there may be a momentum-dependant component which is dominant.
Perhaps a better approach is that with model-independence.
Dark matter is not covered by the Standard Model, and how it behaves at high-energies is unknown.
Therefore, the best way to describe our ignorance is to use an Effective Field Theory (EFT).

\par
EFTs allow for a model to be parameterised to an arbitrary accuracy by describing the physics at only a certain scale.

Although the LZ detector has been built with vanilla dark-matter searches at the forefront of the design, this does not mean that other searches cannot be performed. 

\par
The assumption that the dark-matter interaction with nucleons overlooks the possible sensitivity to different scenarios such as dark-matter with different spins, and interactions with higher nuclear recoil energies.
A wide variation in sensitivity to interactions based on detection medium.

\par
Given the limitations within the standard model, it is natural to ask if there is a possible adaptation to the standard model which would allow to the existence of dark matter - and to explain why we have yet to detect it.
This naturally leads to the introduction of effect theories - an approximation of the complete underlying theory.
The primary benefits of this are that it allows for model-dependent analyses.

\par
Possible the most clear example of an effect field theory in physics is that of Newtonian gravity?

\par
In the more generalised form, this is General Relatively.
However, this is expected to be the low energy effective field theory as it is only valid up to Planck scales.


\par
In the case of dark-matter, the underlying theory is not known or is too complex to compute, so instead we look at some approximation.

\par
An EFT looks at physics at a particular scale in a manner that allows for corrections to arbitrary precision.


\par
The steps for creating an EFT can be boiled down into 4-steps;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the degrees of freedom - not all degrees of freedom are relevant in all cases. For example, a low energy theory does not need to high mass (and so high energy) particles
    \item Symmetries - this is guided by the degrees of freedom
    \item Expansion parameters - this is just power counting ie, to what precision are terms needed
    \item Lagrangian - the simplest Lagrangian can then be developed from the above choices
\end{enumerate}


\par
In this section we follow the approach described in XXX where we treat WIMP-nucleon scattering as a four-field interaction comprising of the WIMP field $\chi$, the nucleon field $N$ and the effective operators $\Operator$;

\begin{equation}
    \Lagrangian_{int} = \chi_{1} \Operator_{\chi} \chi_{2} N_{1} \Operator_{N} N_{2}
\end{equation}
Here, $1$ and $2$ indicate incoming and outgoing particles respectively.

\par
Now, as this theory is non-relativistic, the interaction must be Galilean invariant.
This leaves us with 4 quantities; the change in momentum $\vec{q}$, the relative velocity of the WIMP $\vec{v}=\vec{v}_{\chi,in} - \vec{v}_{N,in}$, the spin of the WIMP $\vec{S}_{\chi}$ and the spin of the nucleon $\vec{S}_{N}$.


% I have these written down as part of it... not clear where I got it from... I think papers
% spin-dependent, spin-independent, angular-momentum dependent and spin and angular-momentum dependent. 


\par
Galilean invariance momentum and velocity;
$\Vec{v} = \Vec{v}_{\chi,in} - \Vec{v}_{N,in}$

\par
Finally we have our set of Galilean-invariant and Hermitian-invariant quantities;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item momentum transfer: $i\Vec{q}$
    \item energy conservation: $\Vec{v}^{\bot}$
    \item nucleon spin: $\Vec{S}_{N}$
    \item dark matter spin: $\Vec{S}_{\chi}$
\end{enumerate}

\par
The invariant quantities can then be combined to form operators;

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\Operator_{1}=1_{\chi}1_N \\ 
\Operator_{2}=\left(v^{\perp}\right)^{2} \\
\Operator_{3}=i \vec{S}_{N} \cdot\left(\frac{\vec{q}}{m_N} \times \vec{v}^{\perp}\right) \\ 
\Operator_{4}=\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \vec{S}_{N} \\ 
\Operator_{5}=i \vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot(\frac{\vec{q}}{m_N} \times \vec{v}^{\perp}) \\ 
\Operator_{6}=\left(\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\right)\left(\vec{S}_{N} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\right) \\
\Operator_{7}=\vec{S}_{N} \cdot \vec{v}^{\perp} \\
\Operator_{8}=\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \vec{v}^{\perp} \\ 
\Operator_{9}=i \vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot\left(\vec{S}_{N} \times \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\right) \\
\Operator_{10}=i \vec{S}_{N} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N} \\ 
\Operator_{11}=i \vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N} \\
\Operator_{12} =\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot\left(\vec{S}_{N} \times \vec{v}^{\perp}\right) \\
\Operator_{13} =i\left(\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \vec{v}^{\perp}\right)\left(\vec{S}_{N} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\right) \\ 
\Operator_{14} =i\left(\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\right)\left(\vec{S}_{N} \cdot \vec{v}^{\perp}\right) \\ 
\Operator_{15} =-\left(\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\right)\left(\left(\vec{S}_{N} \times \vec{v}^{\perp}\right) \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\right)
\end{array}
\label{eq:EFT_Operators}
\end{equation}

\par
When it actually comes to using these operators, the $\mathcal{O}_{2}$ is not considered as it is relativistic. 
Additionally $\mathcal{O}_{16}$ that is mentioned in XXX is a linear combination of $\mathcal{O}_{15}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{12}$ so does not need to be included.

\par
The final piece of the puzzle is how the WIMPs interactions with isoscalars and isovectors could in fact be different.
This means that the complete interaction Lagrangian is;

\begin{equation}
    \Lagrangian_{int} = 
    \label{eq:HENR_Interaction_Lagrangian}
\end{equation}

\section{new writings}
\par
As is hopefully clear to the reader, WIMP-nucleon interactions when constrained by the model discussed previously in this chapter, blah blah blah.
However, the assumption that only spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions are significant may be incorrect, and there may be other corrections (such as momentum dependence) that are the dominant terms.
It is therefore useful to approach a direct dark matter search in a model independent way - namely via an effective field theory (EFT).
An EFT is essentially a simplification of a quantum field theory where only the parameters relevant to the defined scale are kept, with other, irrelevant degrees of freedom integrated out.

\par
In the WIMP-nucleon interaction, an EFT can prob the magnitude and significance of interactions, given that the full theory is not known.
In this section, the model independent approach formulated by Haxton et al is summarised with adaptations from XXX and XXX.

\par
Given the constrained previously described, WIMP-nucleon scattering is a four-field interaction comprising of the WIMP field $\chi$, the nucleon field $N$ and the effective operators $\Operator$:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \Lagrangian_{int} &= \chi_{1} \Operator_{\chi} \chi_{2} N_{1} \Operator_{N} N_{2} \\
                      &= \Operator \chi_{1}\chi_{2} N_{1}N_{2}
\end{split}
\end{align}
Here, $1$ and $2$ indicate incoming and outgoing particles respectively.

\par
Now, we can impose constraints from symmetries.
Firstly, as this theory is non-relativistic, the interaction must be Galilean invariant.



\par
We are also able utilise the conservation of energy.
In the 

\par
Finally we require all operators to correspond to real, physical values, that is to say, be Hermitian.
Unfortunately, both $\vec{q}$ or $\vec{v}$ transform under incoming and outgoing particles as;


\par
Inde

This leaves us with 4 quantities; the change in momentum $\vec{q}$, the relative velocity of the WIMP $\vec{v}=\vec{v}_{\chi,in} - \vec{v}_{N,in}$, the spin of the WIMP $\vec{S}_{\chi}$ and the spin of the nucleon $\vec{S}_{N}$.


\par
The most general Hermititan WIMP-nucleon interaction is then constructed by just four variables: the dark matter spin $\Vec{S}_{\chi}$, the nucleon spin $\Vec{S}_{N}$, the relative velocity of the dark matter to the nucleon, and the momentum transfer.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item nucleon spin: $\Vec{S}_{N}$
    \item dark matter spin: $\Vec{S}_{\chi}$
    \item momentum transfer: $i\Vec{q}$
    \item energy conservation: $\Vec{v}^{\bot}$
\end{enumerate}
\par
Each of these operators carry with them a coefficient of an unknown strength, but which experiments can determine.
A priori we know nothing about the strength of these coefficients, and so we cannot say that we know one operator is more significant than another operator.

\par
It is important to remember that nuclear elastic scattering can constrain these coefficients, but cannot fully determine them, but additional information does appear in inelastic scattering.





\par
Although not shown here, the operators can be extended to account for inelastic scattering.
In this case, the only change is $v^{\perp} \rightarrow v_{inel}^{\perp}=v^{\perp} + \frac{\delta_\chi}{\vert\vec{q}\vert^2}\vec{q}$, where $\delta_\chi$ is the change in dark matter mass \cite{inelastics_eft_ref}.


\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\sigma}{dE_R} \approx G_F^2 \sum_{i} R_i (\vec{v}^{\perp 2}, \frac{\vec{q}^2}{m_N^2}) W_i(q^2b^2)
\end{equation}
$W_i(q^2b^2)$ encompasses the nuclear tensor.
In a direct dark matter experiment, this can be varied to change the nuclear charge, spin, isospin to determine $R_i$.
As there are many different direct dark matter experiment, each with different target nuclei, each with different properties and sensitivities, they combine together to contain the dark matter.
The other term, $R_i (\vec{v}^{\perp 2}, \frac{\vec{q}^2}{m_N^2})$, is the WIMP tensor, containing all of the dark matter particle physics.



\par
At this point, an important decision is taken for an actual analysis.
The nucleons can be described as protons and neutrons ({neutron, proton} basis) or in the {isoscalar, isovector} basis, ie;

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
    H_{ET} = \sum_i a_i \Operator_i \rightarrow \sum_i (c_i^0 + c_i^1 \tau_3)\Operator \\
    c_i^0 = \frac{1}{2}(c_i^p + c_i^n) & c_i^1 = \frac{1}{2}(c_i^p - c_i^n)
\end{array}
\label{eq:EFT_Operators}
\end{equation}

Isoscalar particles are singlets with a total isospin of 0 where as isovector particles are triplet states with a total isospin of 1.
Historically there has been limited consistence, with often the same experiment changing between {neutron, proton} basis and {isoscalar, isovector} basis between data runs.
The choice for some experiments to adopt the {neutron, proton} basis has been driven by the approach adopted for spin-dependent analysis .
In the last few years however, {isoscale, isovector} basis has become more common, with CDMS, XENON100, DEAP-3600 and PandaX-II all reporting results in this basis \cite{cdms_eft_ref,xenon100_eft_ref,deap3600_eft_ref,pandax_2_eft_ref}.
As such the analysis presented later on in Chapter XXX uses this.


\par
This brings us to the recoil rate:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dR}{dE_R} = \frac{\rho_0}{32\pi m_\chi^3 m_N^2} \int_{v>v_{min}} \frac{f(\vec{v})}{v} \sum_{i,j} \sum_{N,N'=n,p} c^{N}_i c^{N'}_j \sum_{k=M, \sum'', \sum', \Lambda, \Sigma'', \tilde{\sigma}'} a_{ijk}F_k^{N,N'}
\label{eq:ref_recoil_spectrum}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Possible Operators}
\par

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \Lagrangian_{int} &= \chi_{1} \Operator_{\chi} \chi_{2} N_{1} \Operator_{N} N_{2} \\
                      &= \Operator \chi_{1}\chi_{2} N_{1}N_{2}
\end{split}
\end{align}
Here, $1$ and $2$ indicate incoming and outgoing particles respectively.

\par
On this interaction we can then impose various symmetries in order to simplify our problem.

\par
Firstly, any operator must be invariant with respect to constant shift in velocities: Galilean invariant.
This allows us to construct two quantities with Galilean invariance: momentum transfer, $\vec{q} = \vec{p}_{\chi 1} - \vec{p}_{\chi 2} = \vec{p}_{N 2} - \vec{p}_{N 1}$, and the incident WIMP velocity, $\vec{v}=\vec{v_\chi} - \vec{v}_N$.

\par
Additionally, the conservation of energy.
This allows us to relate the initial energy, $E$ to the final kinetic energy, $E'$:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    E  &= \frac{1}{2}\mu_N v^2 \\
    E' &= \frac{1}{2}\mu_N v'^2 \\
       &= \frac{1}{2}\mu_N (\vec{v} + \frac{\vec{q}}{\mu_N})
\end{split}
\end{align}
which leaves us with:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{v}\vec{q} = \frac{q^2}{2\mu_N}
\end{equation}
