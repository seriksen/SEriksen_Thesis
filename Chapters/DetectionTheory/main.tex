\chapter{Direct Detection of WIMPs}
\label{chap:detection_theory}
\par
We have seen in the previous chapter that there is a wealth of evidence for some particle or particle combination that is missing from our understanding of particle physics.
In this Chapter, we focus on WIMPs that were introduced in \autoref{sec:wimp_as_a_candidate}, and how they may interact with nucleons in a way that can be detected by Earth based detectors.
