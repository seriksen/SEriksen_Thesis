\chapter{Direct Detection of WIMPs}
\label{chap:detection_theory}
\par
We have seen in the previous chapter that there is a wealth of evidence for some particle or particle combinations that is missing from our understanding of particle physics.
In this chapter, we focus on WIMPs that were introduced in \autoref{sec:wimp_as_a_candidate}, and how they may interact with nucleons in a way that Earth-based detectors can detect.

\subsubsection*{Summary}
\par
In this chapter, the principles of direct searches for WIMPs by Earth-based detectors were introduced.
This began with an explanation of WIMP-nucleon interactions and how the rate of these can be calculated.
The two parameters, the dark matter distribution and the interaction cross-section, that are detector-agnostic and contribute to the interaction rate, were explained.
The equations for the differential recoil rate for spin-independent dark matter scattering was then determined.
Finally, an effective field theory was introduced to describe a generalised WIMP-nucleon interaction.
