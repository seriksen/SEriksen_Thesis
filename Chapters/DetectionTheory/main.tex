\chapter{Direct Detection of Dark Matter}

\par
We have seen in the previous chapter that both there is a wealth of evidence for some particle or particle combination that is missing from our understanding of particle physics.
Equally there are just as many proposed solutions.
In this Chapter, we focus on WIMPs that were introduced in \autoref{sec:wimp_as_a_candidate}, and how they might be detected in direct dark matter experiments.
