\section{WIMP Interaction} \label{wimp_theory}

\par
The process which is trying to be observed is the elastic scattering of a WIMP off a target nucleus of masses $m_{\chi}$ and $m_{N}$ respectively.
From the transfer of momentum $q$, the nucleus recoils with energy $E_{R}$ given by
\begin{equation}
    E_{R} = \frac{q^{2}}{2m_{N}} = \frac{\mu^2\nu_{\chi}^2}{m_{N}}(1-\cos(\theta))
\end{equation}

where $\nu_{\chi}$ is the incoming WIMP velocity, $\theta$ is the scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame, and $\mu=\frac{m_{\chi}m_{N}}{m_{\chi} + m_{N}}$
