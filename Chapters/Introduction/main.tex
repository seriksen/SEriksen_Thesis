Welcome welcome welcome...
Let me present you with ... "A Thesis, By Samuel Rymer Eriksen"

\par
This thesis begins with a description of the evidence for DM and a selection of the particles which have been hypothesised to explain it.
\par
In \autoref{chap:detection_theory} the theory of how WIMPs may be detected via nuclear recoils on Earth based detectors is explored. 
The formulatoin of a model independent appraoch is introduced in the form of an effective field theory.

\par
\autoref{sec:lz_detector_chapter} introduced how xenon can be used to search for WIMPs in dual-phase time projection chamber experiments.
The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment is then introduced, along with the dark matter search strategy.

\par
In \autoref{chap:lz_simulations} key developments to the LZ simulation framework are described, with focus on migration of CPU-based simulations to a GPU implementation.

\par
\autoref{chapter:lz_outer_detector} details the Outer Detector, what it is constructed from and it's primary function.
Design changes which occurred during it's construction are described.
Finally the expected performance from simulations are presented.

\par
In \autoref{chap:analysis_of_the_od} the same performance requirements introduced in the previous chapter are examined in the completed detector.
These are used to set a key analysis cut used in the first science run of LZ.

\par
The final analysis is presented in \autoref{chap:analysis_eft_work}.
A projected sensitivity study of LZ to EFT operators is presented along with limits from the first science run.
