As discussed in the previous chapter, there is a reasonable expectation that, if dark matter is comprised at least in part by WIMPs, then a WIMP-nucleus scattering is detectable.
The question then becomes, what is the optimal target to detect this scattering.
Any target see multiple interactions from various particle such as $\beta$'s and $\gamma$'s.
Fortunately, the majority of these will interact in the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus and result in an electronic recoil (ER).
This differs from the nuclear recoil (NR) which would be observed from a WIMP-nucleon interaction.
Therefore to detect a WIMP we are searching for an excess in NR events compared to out background.

\par
Therefore in order to achieve this, a target with minimal isotopes that will decay and cause an excess to be hidden need to be avoided.
Additionally, any detector design should allow for particle discrimination - or more explicit ER and NR discrimination.
