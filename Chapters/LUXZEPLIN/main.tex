\chapter{The LUX-ZEPLIN Experiment}
\label{sec:lz_detector_chapter}

As discussed in the previous chapter, there is a reasonable expectation that if dark matter is comprised at least in part of WIMPs, then WIMP-nucleon scattering should be detectable.
The question then becomes, what is the optimal detector to detect this scattering?
As the WIMP-nucleon scattering is a rare event, a low background detector design is required.
Regardless of what the detector is made from, there will always be some backgrounds, most commonly $\beta$s and $\gamma$s that need to be categorised and removed.

In this chapter, the concepts of xenon-based dark matter detectors are introduced.
This is then followed by the presentation of the LUX-ZEPLIN dark matter experiment upon which the analyses in this thesis are based.
This is not the only type of dark matter detector, and for a description of other detector designs, the reader is directed to \cite{direct_detector_designs_ref}.
