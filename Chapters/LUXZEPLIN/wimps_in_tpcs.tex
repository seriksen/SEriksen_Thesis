\section{WIMP identification in Xenon}
\label{sec:wimps_with_xenon}

\par
The high atomic mass of Xe is of benefit for spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering as can be seen in EQUATION XXX where there is a $A^2$ enhancement.
Additionally, Xe is sensitive to spin-dependent interactions as natural Xe two isotopes which odd-neutrons; ${}^{129}Xe$ and ${}^{131}Xe$ which isotopic abundances of 26.4\% and 21.1\% respectively.
Though the sensitivity to WIMP-proton spin-dependent interactions is less obvious as it requires neutron-proton mixing and is very dependent upon the nuclear model used.

\par
A further benefit of Xe is that it does not naturally contain any long-lived radioactive isotopes, or activation products.
There are however several isotopes than can be produced by cosmogenically: and two metastable isotopes ${}^{129m}Xe$ and ${}^{131m}Xe$.


\par
In a liquid state, Xe has a relatively high density of approximately 3g/cm${}^{3}$\footnote{for reference, aluminium has a density of 2.7g/cm${}^{3}$}.



\subsection{Energy deposits in Xenon}
\par
From an interacting particle to atomic electrons, the energy transfer will result in scintillation photons.
The 



Following the convention of XXX, the energy deposited in a medium from a recoil, $E_R$, is split between the atoms and the liberated electrons from the nuclei.

In \autoref{fig:er_nr_discrimination} the discrimination between ER and NR events for an arbitrary detector is shown.
