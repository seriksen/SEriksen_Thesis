\par
In this chapter, the Outer Detector (OD) is described, along with an insight into its subsystems.
The construction and installation underground are discussed, and the simulated veto performance is presented against a number of performance requirements.

\subsubsection*{Summary}

\par
In this chapter the OD was described with its existence motivated by the need to have a detector that can veto neutron events.
The way in which neutrons are captured and the resultant particle cascade was also shown.
The construction of the OD was described with pictures to shown where different materials were located.
The design changes which occurred during the construction, including the TeePee design and the raising of the top acrylic tanks were shown.
The backgrounds which are expected in the OD were determined by the mass of components and linked to the radioassay of materials.
Finally the neutron tagging efficiency in simulations was evaluated on a set of simulations which took into account the design changes.
It was shown that the requirement of a 95\% veto efficiency may not be reached, with 91\% measured.
The simulated neutron capture time was also calculated.
