\section{OD Construction and Installation} 
\label{sec:od_construction_sec}
\par
The author spent a total of 15-months in the United States as part of his PhD, the majority of which was spent on-site at SURF for both the TPC and OD assembly and installation.
In this section, a subset of the contributions to the OD installation are described (primarily through photographs), along with design changes that occurred during installation.
%It should be noted that due to COVID-19, the schedule for the installation was severely delayed (18+ months).

\par
The acrylic tanks used to hold the GdLS, manufactured by Reynolds Polymer Technology, Inc. \cite{reynolds_acrlyic_ref}, were originally designed to be 2.54cm thick, however, the curved moulds used could not provide the accuracy to maintain this requirement whilst also having smooth outer edges, and therefore the thickness of acrylic varied by as much as 1.3cm, affecting the structural integrity of the tanks.
The acrylic tanks were bonded together and sealed before being transported to SURF.
An overview of the tank construction method can be found in \cite{scotthaselschwardt_thesis_ref}.

\par
Once at SURF, the SATs were transported underground and into the water tank before the OCV, in 2018, as planned in the TDR \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref}.
They remained secured to the water tank outer-walls until the OD installation was ready to begin in 2020. 

\par
The TATs were first brought underground in August 2019 for a fit test on top of the OCV (before the ICV has been installed inside).
During the cage journey underground, the tanks valves were opened so that the pressure change would not damage them.
As such, once at the 4850 level, each tank was subjected to a N2 purge to remove as much of the cavern air as possible to reduce radon plate-out.
The N2 purge setup is shown in \autoref{fig:TAT_purging}.
During this process, it was discovered by the author that the top acrylic sheet had come away from the bond holding it to the side acrylic pieces.
This was later re-bonded, but is mentioned here as it meant that the tank was exposed to cavern air for a prolonged period of time.
Additionally, during the fit test, it was found that the curvature of the TATs differed from the OCV which would leave a large water-gap between the two, increasing the probability of n-H capture.

\par
The proposed solution was to `correct the curvature' with additional foam on top of the OCV, which due to construction delays and COVID-19, did not begin until August 2020.
The foam used for this was Styrodur\textsuperscript{\textregistered} \cite{styrodur_foam_ref}.
This was chosen as it has a high compression strength.
It also had the benefit of being onsite as it was already planned to be used around the side tanks and was assayed in \cite{LZ_assay_ref}, namely 
The primary bonding methods used to secure the foam to the OCV was HandiFoam\textsuperscript{\textregistered} \cite{handifoam_ref}.
HandiFoam\textsuperscript{\textregistered} was chosen as it securely held test pieces together, but also would fill in any potential gaps.
Additionally, the foam was held in place with titanium pins, and titanium rods.
Part of the installation is shown in \autoref{fig:TAT_foam_installation}.

\par
The SAT-OCV foam was installed after the TAT-OCV foam in a slightly different fashion.
These pieces were primarily secured together using silicon sealant \cite{dowsil_silicone_ref} to each other and the OCV.
Titanium pins were also used to secure pieces together and trapping them behind the bolts on the OCV.
The final fit-test is shown in \autoref{fig:sat_foam_fit_test} along with the primary OD installers.

\par
As the foam had been underground for a number of weeks prior to being used, radon chain particles are likely to have embedded themselves in each piece of foam.
To remove this, each piece of foam installed underwent a final `shaving', where a few mm was removed from each side.
This is shown in \autoref{fig:sat_foam_shaving}.

\par
Additional foam was installed around the OCV legs in between the BATs.
This foam was secured using HandiFoam\textsuperscript{\textregistered} as shown in \autoref{fig:ocv_leg_foam}.

Because of the aforementioned split tank and thin walls, there was a danger that the tanks may leak GdLS.
This is not necessarily a problem as GdLS is oil-based so would float to the top of the water, allowing it to be collected easily.
However it does not react well with either Tyvek or foam, both of which surround the OCV, and so any leaking GdLS would inevitably come into contact with them.
Over long exposure the optical reflectivity of Tyvek is damaged, reducing light collection in the OD, but would still work to some extent.
The foam on the other hand would degrade sufficiently that it would not longer serve its purpose as a water displacer after any contact.
As such, polyethylene sheets were installed to cover the foam.
On top of this, the Tyvek was installed.
In addition, the OD-Tyvek shape around the TAT was changed.
Previously this was a flat Tyvek sheet lying on top of the TAT and out to the OD PMTs.
However, in order to allow for a potential GdLS leak to reach the surface, a TeePee design was adopted.
This was so that any GdLS leak would be able to follow a path to the top of the water.

\par
During the BAT test-fitting, it was found that these also did not match the curvature of the OCV.
Additionally, because of the placement of the BAT securing feet, they were not stable.
This mean that as the water tank was filled, the BATs would be able to rock and bash into the OCV and potentially break their feet off, causing a leak.
The installation solution was to secure the BATs as much as possible with foam.
A different, thinner foam was selected for this purpose as a degree of flexibility was required to follow the OCV curve.
In this place 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch polyethylene foam were selected \cite{white_foam_ref}.
Additionally, HandiFoam\textsuperscript{\textregistered} was used for smaller places that could not be reached.
The final BAT installation is shown in \autoref{fig:BAT_installation}.

In additional to what has been mentioned, the SATs were secured using titanium plates.
To even the load the SATs experiences, 1-inch thick polyethylene foam was installed above and below.
Additional foam was installed and secured with HandiFoam\textsuperscript{\textregistered} around the High Voltage port, where previously this was just water.
This is shown in \autoref{fig:hv_port_foam}.

\par
On top of everything Tyvek was installed, and the PMT ladders erected around the SATs.
The culmination of all of this is the completed OD, shown in \autoref{fig:complete_od}.
%The use of a single layer will have a performance reduction with the reflectivity reducing by $\approx$10\% compared to multiple layers bonded together \cite{tyvek_reflectivity_ref}.

During the installation described above, the cavern blasting for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) began \cite{dune_blasting_ref}.
There was a concern that the pressure change caused by this would damage the tanks.
To stop this, the valves of the tanks were opened whenever there was a planned blast.
This left the inside of each tank open to the cavern-air during this time, which potentially allowed them to become contaminated.


\subsection{Simulation Adaptation}
\par
Many of these design changes, whether it be material or geometrical will have some effect on the performance on the OD.
All large changes have been implemented in the simulation: the raised TATs, the additional foam, the Tyvek TeePee, and the change in acrylic thickness.
What is implemented within the simulation can be seen \autoref{fig:Geometry_Differences} where the differences between design as as-built are highlighted in red.
