\section{Detector Overview} \label{OD_detector_overview}
\par
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:lz_detector}, the Outer Detector is an active veto used to increase the usable xenon volume in the TPC.
In this section, a detailed explanation of the OD is provided.

\subsection{Function}
\par
As previously discussed, it is possible that a dark matter candidate will scatter once in the target medium and then leave the experiment.
Other sources are able to interact in the target medium, such and neutrons and $\gamma$'s, mimicking dark matter.
However there is a reasonably probability of these scattering before or after they enter the TPC volume.
LZ makes use of this feature using anti-coincidence veto detectors, the Skin and Outer Detector (OD);
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Skin}: a Xenon skin that surrounds the TPC inside the cryovessel.
    \item \textbf{OD}: a liquid scintillator held in acrylic tanks around the cryovessel which surrounded by ultra pure water.
\end{itemize}
Each of these detectors are made active by PMTs.
\par
If an interaction is detected in either of these within some window around when a single scatter is observed in the TPC then the event can be tagged as a background.
These detectors also allow for a continuous characterisation of backgrounds in the proximity of LZ which can be fed into parameterising background models.


\par
The OD is of vital importance as 46\% of neutrons with enter the TPC will capture in the OD as shown in \autoref{fig:simulated_neutron_capture_volumes}.
A working veto is vital to LZ being a significant step forward in dark matter direct-detection sensitivity.

\subsection{OD Scintillator}
\par
The liquid scintillator (LS) contains three components; a solvent made from linear-alkylbenzene (LAB), a fluor of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), and a wavelength shifter of 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl(benzene)) (bis-MSB).
Energy deposited in the LS will excite LAB molecules, which will generally transfer it's energy to the fluor. 
The fluor will emit an light at a wavelength peaking below 380nm which is not ideal for detection due to self-absorption.
This scintillation is absorbed bis-MSB and emitted at a better wavelength (in terms of detectability), as it is less absorbed by the LS and matches closer the PMT response (discussed later in this section), peaking at around 410-425nm.
The absorption length and emission spectrum are shown in \autoref{fig:od_detection_properties}.
Importantly, the absorption length of the GdLS increases from 1m to in excess of 10m in that range - and continues to rise.

\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/gdls_wavelengths}

\par
To improved neutron capture and reduce the veto window length, the LS is doped with 0.1\% by mass (0.23 - 0.34\% by number) Gadolinium.
This is dissolved into the LS via a chelating agent 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoic acid (TMHA), with three TMHA ions per Gd creating $Gd({C}_{9}{H}_{17}{O}_{2})_{3}$.
The GdLS used in LZ was produced in a batch used for DayaBay, the details of doping can be found in \cite{dayabay_gd_doping_ref}.
The complete cocktail of components in the GdLS is shown in \autoref{tab:GdLS_Components}.

    $C_{24}H_{22}$ (Bis-MSB) & wavelength shifter & 310.4 & 0.015 \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Components in 1L of GdLS}
    \label{tab:GdLS_Components}
\end{table} 
\par
Although only a small amount of Gadolinium is added, it is sufficient to reduce the neutron capture time down from $\approx$218$\mu$s of pure LAB (TODO CITE XXX) down to $\approx$28$\mu$s \cite{ucsb_gdls_dicebox_simulations_ref}.


\subsection{Acrylic Tanks}
\par
The GdLS is contained in a total of ten ultra-violet transparent acrylic tanks providing nearly a complete 4$\pi$ coverage around the OCV.
Four side tanks (SATs) that curve around the OCV, three bottom tanks (BATs) under the OCV between it's legs, two top tanks (TATs), and a final smaller tank - the YBe plug which is removable to be replaced by the YBe source.
Between the SATs and OCV, foam pieces are installed to displace water.
\autoref{fig:LZ_OD_Tanks} shows each of the tanks positions.
Details of the construction of the tanks can be found in \cite{scotthaselschwardt_thesis_ref}.
\begin{figure}

    \caption{Exploded view of the OD acrylic tanks.}
    \label{fig:LZ_OD_Tanks}
\end{figure}

\par
The shape of the OCV includes a large flange halfway down it. 
This means that the SATs cannot be placed next to the OCV wall and the area will fill with water.
In order to reduce this foam is placed between the OCV and SATs.
This is shown in more detail in \autoref{sec:od_construction_sec}.

\subsection{OD PMTs}
\par
The OD is made active by an array of 120 Hamamatsu R5912 8"-diameter PMTs suspended in water $\approx$80cm from the acrylic tanks.
The PMTs are arranged as 20-ladders spaced evenly around the water tank as shown in \autoref{fig:od_pmt_placement}.
These PMTs are biased to provide an gain on the input of in-excess of $10^{5}$.
Every PMT has a quantum efficiency - essentially the number of detected electrons against the number of incident photons - which for the dominant wavelengths put out by the GdLS is around 20\%, as shown in \autoref{fig:od_pmt_qe}.

    \label{fig:od_pmt_placement}
\end{figure}

\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/od_pmt_qe}


\par
Each PMT was tested in Korea to asserting the voltage required for each gain and to ensure the noise from each PMT was within the requirements.
A number of these PMTs failed something or another (need to ask Ryan).
The replacements were taken to Brandeis University where the gains, dark-rates and single-photoelecon (SPE) level.
These were performed by placing the a PMT in a light-tight dark box, and pulsing a single LED based upon a development kit for the OCS system \cite{lz_ocs_system_ref}.
The setup is shown in \autoref{fig:od_pmt_brandeis_measurements}.
Several of the PMTs tested had lower dark-rates at the required gain and so replaced several PMTs of a higher rate.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Tyvek}
\par
To increase the amount of light collected by the PMTs, OD is encased in Tyvek.
In dominant scintillation wavelengths (400-500nm), the reflectivity remains above 80\% in water \cite{tyvek_thesis_ref,tyvek_reflectivity_ref}. 
Tyvek was selected over other reflective boundaries (such as Lumirror{\texttrademark}) due to it's lower radioactivity.
Details of the Tyvek placement are discussed in \autoref{sec:od_construction_sec}.
\par
With the addition of a high-reflectivity surface the light collection efficiency in the OD tanks is on average 7.4\%, but with some significant variability as shown in \autoref{fig:od_lce}.
This LCE map is what is expected after the design changes discussed in the next \autoref{sec:od_construction_sec}.
