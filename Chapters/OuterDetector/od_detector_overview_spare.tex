\section{Detector Overview} \label{OD_detector_overview}

\par
The Outer Detector (OD) has been designed as part of an active veto system - as an anti-coincidence detector to efficiently tag background events that would otherwise appear in the WIMP analysis.
This allows for a larger portion of the TPC Xenon to be used for a WIMP search as the background rate is reduced, increasing the \textbf{FID} from 3.2 to 5.6 tonnes \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref}.



\subsection{GdLS}
\par
The core of the OD is the ability to capture neutrons.
This is done by a liquid scintillator doped with natural gadolinium (GdLS)
The components of this cocktail are detailed in Table \ref{tab:GdLS_Components}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}


\par
The OD is broken up into two parts; a volume of ultra-pure water and a scintillor layer.
Both volumes are made active by an array of PMTs.

\subsection{Water and PMTs}
\par
The outermost region of the OD is a Tyvek curtain, separating the OD from the edge of the water tank.
Attached the Tyvek wall, 120 Hamamatsu R5912 8"-diameter PMTs point inwards.
For an 420nm incident photon the PMT quantum efficiency is in excess of 25\%, with the full wavelength shown in Figure \ref{fig:od_pmt_qe}.

\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/od_pmt_qe}

\subsection{Tyvek}
\par
The OD is entirely encased by Tyvek paper to improve light collection efficiency. 
In dominant scintillation wavelengths (400-500nm), the reflectivity remains above 80\% in water \cite{tyvek_thesis_ref,tyvek_reflectivity_ref}. 
Tyvek was selected over other reflective boundaries (such as Lumirror{\texttrademark} due to it's.
Other options



\subsection{Acrylic Tanks}
\par
The scintillator is housed in ten ultra-violet transparent acrylic tanks.
Four side tanks (SATs) that curve around the OCV, three bottom tanks (BATs) under the OCV between it's legs, two top tanks (TATs), and a final smaller tank - the YBe plug which is removable to be replaced by the YBe source.
Between the SATs and OCV, foam pieces are installed to displace water.
Figure \ref{fig:LZ_OD_Tanks} shows each of the tanks positions.
Details of the construction of the tanks can be found in \cite{scotthaselschwardt_thesis_ref}.

    \caption{Exploded view of the OD acrylic tanks.}
    \label{fig:LZ_OD_Tanks}
\end{figure}

\par
The tanks are filled with a Gadolinium-doped Liquid Scintillator (GdLS).

linear akylbenze (LAB) as the liquid scintillator.
This is doped with 0.1\% by mass (0.23 - 0.34\% by number) Gadolinium.

\par
The GdLS is combined with TMHA (the chelating agent) and dissolved in the LS.
The components of this cocktail are summarised in Table \ref{tab:GdLS_Components}.


\subsection{Scintillator}
\par
The scintillation cocktail which fills the OD tanks made up of five ingredients.




is a linear alkylbenzene (LAB).

In this, neutron capture happens on the hydrogen; $n + p \xrightarrow{} d + \gamma$ with a capture constant of 200$\mu$s \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref}.
The hydrogen capture produces a single 2.2MeV $\gamma$.
\par
The scintillator in the OD is doped with 0.1\% (by mass) by Gadolinium.
This provides 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item cross section 49kb: (61kb for $Gd^{155}$ and 254kb for $Gd^{157}$)
    \item capture energy release: 8536.39keV ($Gd^{155} \xrightarrow{} Gd^{156}$) and 7937.39keV ($Gd^{157} \xrightarrow{} Gd^{158}$)
    \item More released particles (4.7, $\gamma$'s and $e^{-}$)
    \item neutron-capture time = 30$\mu$s
    \item 9000 optical photons per MeV. Not sure where this number has some from
\end{enumerate}

\par
LZ dopes with 0.1\% by mass (0.23 - 0.34\% by number)

\par
In addition to the gadolinium doping, the scintillator is also made up of two wavelength shifters; a primary shifter (or fluor) and a second wavelength shifter.
The fluor is 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO); an organic scintillator which converts shorter wavelength light to longer wavelength light. 
This has a spectrum peak at 385nm (UV).
The second wavelength shifter is 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl(benzene)) (Bis-MSB). 
Bis-MSB absorbs the PPO scintillation and emits with peak of around 410-425nm.
The reason for the second shifter is that the wavelength emitted is absorbed less by the LS and is closer to the PMT response.
Importantly, the absorption length of the GdLS increases from 1m to in excess of 10m in that range - and continues to rise.

\par
The complete chemical components in the GdLS is shown in Table \ref{tab:GdLS_Components}.

\end{table} 

\paragraph{Other Properties}
It is also worth noting that proton scatters and $\alpha$'s have quenched scintillation signals.
For the proton, it is most easily described by the effect of neutron collisions.

\par
In the lab-frame, the ratio between a neutrons initial energy ($E$) and final energy ($E'$) when colliding with an at rest nucleus of mass A follows;
\begin{equation}
    \frac{E'}{E} = \frac{A^2 + 1 + 2A\cos{\theta}}{(A + 1)^2}
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the scattering angle in the CoM.
Now, if the nucleus is a hard sphere, so independent of $\theta$, then an elastic scatter follows
\begin{equation}
    E^{'} = E(\frac{A-1}{1})^{2}
\end{equation}
If A = 1 (so is a proton), then it reduces further to $E^{'} = \frac{1}{2}E$, meaning that the neutron loses half its energy on average.
The scattered proton has energy $E - E^{'}$ and is quenched.

\section{Neutron Capture}
\par
After the neutron capture the gadolinium enters an excited state. 
For $Gd^{156}$ this is 8536.39keV and for $Gd^{158}$ is 7937.39keV.
This energy is released as follows;

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Via gamma-rays emission from the decay of an excited nucleus
    \item Internal conversion which leads to
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item auger electron emission
        \item characteristic x-ray emission
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Dicebox Simulations}
\par
Geant4 is unable so accurately simulate accurately some $\gamma$-decay from excited nuclei.
LUX-ZELPIN circumvented this by using DICEBOX - a monte-carlo package for simulating these decays.
Given that $Gd^{155}$ and $Gd^{157}$ have the largest cross sections and together account for 30\% of abundance, only those were simulated.
The results of these simulations are summarised in this section, and are selected randomly during LZ simulations.
The simulation process performed by LZ collaborators can be found in \cite{ucsb_gdls_dicebox_simulations_ref}.

\par
Figure \ref{fig:Gd_capture_resulting_particle_count} shows the number of discrete packets of energy over which the energy is released after the capture.
The mean value of this (from the 10 million simulations) is 4.654 and 4.754 for $Gd^{156}$ and $Gd^{158}$ respectively.
This is why it is often quoted that the neutron capture releases 4.7 $\gamma$'s.

\end{figure}

\par
The simulation encompasses both $\gamma$-emission from the nucleus directly as well as the transfer of energy to an electron (internal conversion).
Where the energy goes within the atom is shown in Table \ref{tab:Gd_internal_energy_conversion}.
It shows that there is also a gamma emitted and that roughly 30\% of the time only $\gamma$'s are emitted, however it is most likely that energy is also passed to a shell electron.
From this, we can conclude that the dominant emission from the neutron capture are $\gamma$'s, with auger electrons and x-rays comprising a much smaller percentage of the emission.
\par
A less useful Figure is Figure \ref{fig:Gd_capture_energy_conversion_shells} shows where the energy goes in terms of electron shells.

\section{Released Particles}
\par
The particles released as a result of the neutron capture ($\gamma$'s and $e^{-}$'s) then follow Birk's law, shown in equation \ref{eq:birkslaw}.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dL}{dx} = S \frac{\frac{dE}{dx}}{1 + k_{B}\frac{dE}{dx} + C\frac{dE}{dx}^2}
    \label{eq:birkslaw}
\end{equation}
Here, L is the the light yield, S is the scintillation efficiency, $\frac{dE}{dx}$ is the energy loss of the particle per path length, and $k_{B}$ and $C$ are Birk's law parameters.
The parameters for GdLS are shown in table \ref{tab:Birks_law_parameters}.
