\section{OD requirements}
\par
As previously stated, the primary purpose of the OD is to act as an active veto for neutrons.
Practically, this means that there are a number of performance requirements which the OD has to meet, all of which can be found in \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref}.
A subset, which are address in this Thesis are presented in Table \ref{tab:veto_requirements}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{0.3\textwidth}p{0.6\textwidth}} %{ c | c {\textwidth} } 
    \hline
    {Requirement Number} & {Description} \\ \hline
    R-160001             & Detection efficiency of 95\% for a 1 MeV neutron that scatters once in the xenon \\
    R-160005             & Must not veto more than 5\% of the WIMP search live-time
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Selection of the OD veto performance requirements. Adapted from Table 12.2.6 from \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref}}
    \label{tab:veto_requirements}
\end{table} 

\par
The veto method adopted by LZ is to act as a 'dumb' veto, as no attempt will be made to determine that cause of light seen in the OD.
This means that an event will be vetoed if the following two conditions are met;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A pulse is seen with an energy above the veto threshold.
    \item The pulse is within the veto window.
\end{enumerate}
The two requirements in Table \ref{tab:veto_requirements} are clearly intertwined.
The veto window and threshold are primarily determined by the background rate in the OD in order to reduce the impact on live-time.
This does however need to be balanced to maintain a suitable veto efficiency.

\subsection{OD Backgrounds}
\par
A background in the OD is any event that is not what it was designed to detect and veto - so any event that is not a neutron or $\gamma$ that has scattered once in the TPC.
There are three significant sources of backgrounds for the OD; Cavern-$\gamma$'s, impurities in the GdLS and other LZ detector components.
Additionally, during data-taking electronic noise will contribute to the background rate. 

\subsubsection{GdLS impurities}
\par
In order to ascertain the rate of internal contaminants expected, a campaign was undertaken \cite{scotthaselschwardt_thesis_ref} to determine this, the results from which are shown in Table \ref{tab:gdls_assay_rates}.
The decay chains and associated sub-chains are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay_chains}.

\par
One of the key outcomes of the screener campaign was the high ${}^{235}U$ rate.
As such, the method of doping the LS was altered, which aimed to reduce the contamination.
The expected rates from this are also shown in Table \ref{tab:gdls_assay_rates}.
However, as these were not screened the accuracy is unknown, but gives a 'best-case'.
The high ${}^{14}{C}$ rate prompted the veto threshold to be set to 200keV (100keV was originally proposed).

\par
During filling of the OD tanks the mass of GdLS was measured as 16.8 tonnes, a 500kg decrease on values used in pre-construction analysis, which will reduce the rate expected by $\approx$3\%.

\end{table}

\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/decay_chains}


\subsubsection{Cavern-$\gamma$'s}
\par
Another outcome of the LS Screener campaign was the requirement for a dedicated Cavern-$\gamma$ study which was mentioned in Section \ref{sec:cavern_gamma_generator}.
This showed that the rate of these $\gamma$'s may in fact be $\approx$50\% of what was anticipated in the TDR \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref} (See Table \ref{tab:cavern_gamma_generator_parameters}).
Despite this reduction, they are expected to be the dominant background above 2MeV, but uncertainty on the rate is a concern.

\subsubsection{LZ Detector Components}
\par
A third source are decays originating from other components which are all contaminated with trace radioimpurities, the vast majority of which were subject to an assay \cite{LZ_assay_ref}.
These were shown in \cite{scotthaselschwardt_thesis_ref} to contribute as much as 11.9Hz to the OD rate above 200keV with the majority (5.5Hz) from the acrylic tanks and associated support structure.
Table \ref{tab:gdls_non_assayed_activities} contains the activities of the components that are in closest proximity to the GdLS and were installed as part of the installation described in Section \ref{sec:od_construction_sec}.
Several materials in the table were not part of the original assay set.
The mass estimates of soft materials are the author's own, based upon measurements and logs taken whilst on-site.
The simulations were only performed using energy deposits, no optical propagation, with those properties accounted for, the observed rate may be lower.

    \label{tab:gdls_non_assayed_activities}
\end{table}

\par
In addition to the measurements in Table \ref{tab:gdls_non_assayed_activities}, the OCV was subject to the cavern air for a prolonged period of time so there may be a build up of Radon dust which is not taken into account.
Similarly, the frequent opening of the valves on the OD tanks (as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:cavern_gamma_generator}) will have allowed for cavern-air and dust to enter the tanks.
Quantifying this will not be possible without damaging the tanks, but it may be an unexpected feature in data.


\subsubsection{Summary}
\par
A new set of simulations were performed to determine the expected rate of backgrounds in the OD.
These anticipated rates at key energy thresholds are provided in Table \ref{tab:od_expected_rates}.
There have been numerous pre-construction studies to determine the expected background rate in the OD including \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref,LZ_projected_sensitivity_paper_ref,sallyshaw_thesis_ref,scotthaselschwardt_thesis_ref,lz_od_taup_2019_ref}, each of which has a significantly different value from between 56Hz and 230Hz above 200keV.
\par
The rates of LZ components and Cavern-$\gamma$'s differ here compared to previous background studies as the simulated OD geometry has improved and more sources have been taken into account.
Assuming that the thresholds predicted with the improved purification of the GdLS, it may be possible for the veto threshold to be reduced to 100keV.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Efficiency}
\par
The most prevalent neutron sources that can enter the TPC are from ($\alpha$,n) reactions and spontaneous fission.
($\alpha$,n) are the most dangerous in terms of number expected, but also as only a single neutron will be released.
Neutrons from spontaneous fission predominantly from uranium (USF) are of less concern as multiple neutrons are released \cite{usf_ref}, often with higher energies and they are accompanied by $\gamma$'s and $\beta$'s so vetoing these is of less concern.
The neutron energy distribution expected in LZ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:simulation_background_neutron_energies}.
\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/background_neutron_energies}

\par
A neutron only needs to be vetoed if it scatters once in the TPC (\textbf{SS}), depositing energy an amount of energy in the region of intersect (\textbf{ROI}) in the fiducial region of the Xenon (\textbf{FID}).
The efficiency, $\epsilon$, of vetoing these events is defined as;
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon = \frac{\text{events passing}\mathbf{SS, ROI, FID, Vetos}}{\text{events passing}\mathbf{SS, ROI, FID}}
    \label{eq:neutron_efficiency}
\end{equation}

\par
Previously, simulations of a limited background neutron sample demonstrated that a 97\% efficiency could be achieved with a 200keV veto threshold and 500$\mu$s veto window \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref}.
Since the OD geometry was significantly altered as described in Section \ref{sec:od_construction_sec}, this has been performed again here.
Rather than simulations of background neutrons from ($\alpha$,n) and USF, mono-energetic neutrons that originate inside the TPC \textbf{FID} region simulations were used.
Essentially this meant that each neutron was in a 'post-\textbf{SS}' state, having already scattered.

\par
The \textbf{FID} was defined as in \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref}, to be a cylinder inside the TPC; 1.5cm above to cathode and 9cm before the anode.
The volume extends out 68.8cm radially to be 1.5cm from the TPC wall.

\par
The simulations performed used energy deposits only primarily for the computational saving, the probability of a 1MeV neutron passing the SS is 0.005-0.0007\footnote{This is from TDR-era simulations which had a lot of neutron-scatter related physics disabled in the simulation.} \cite{sallyshaw_thesis_ref}.
Three neutron energies were selected; 100keV, 1MeV and 6MeV.
For this, the efficiency is defined as;
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon = \frac{\text{events passing}\mathbf{Vetos}}{\text{N. Events}}
    \label{eq:reduced_neutron_efficiency}
\end{equation}
The result are shown in Figure \ref{fig:neutron_eff_energy_dep_tpc_neutrons} alongside a previous study from the TDR-era.
In Figure \ref{fig:neutron_eff_energy_dep_tpc_neutrons}, three energy thresholds are presented which refer to the total energy deposited in the GdLS.

\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/tpc_neutron_efficiency}

\par
Figure \ref{fig:neutron_eff_energy_dep_tpc_neutrons} provides two results.
The first, and possibly most importantly is that it is expected that the requirement R-160001 remains satisfied and a veto window of 500$\mu$s remains adequate.
Secondly, the energy of the neutron may be an important factor in the performance of the veto.
Not only will the neutron reach the GdLS faster, the higher energy it has, but it also has that much more energy to lose via potentially more detectable scatters\footnote{A proton scatter taking $\approx$50\% of the neutrons energy} before being captured.
As to whether this is detectable in data will depend upon the true light collection efficiency being high enough to overcome quenching.

\subsection{Simulated Calibration Efficiency}
\par
The efficiency shown in Figure \ref{fig:neutron_eff_energy_dep_tpc_neutrons} shows that the requirement will be met but it will need to be confirmed using a calibration source.
LZ has four neutron sources available during calibration which are summarised in Table \ref{tab:LZ_Used_Calibration_Sources}.
In this section the veto efficiency from AmLi, an ($\alpha$,n) source, is calculated.
AmLi produces neutrons predominantly under 0.5MeV with the full spectrum is shown in Figure \ref{fig:amli_neutron_energy_spectrum}.
Of the four neutron sources designated for SR1 it is the most flexible and clean; flexible as it can be placed inside the cyrovessel (inside a CSD), but it also has a very low $\gamma$ rate that can escape the source housing.

\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/amli_neutron_energy}

\par
Simulations were again performed of energy depositions only, where the AmLi source was set inside CSD-1.
Three source locations were chosen which are listed below. A graphical depiction is shown in Figure \ref{fig:CSD1_Geometry}. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{0mm:} In line with the cathode
    \item \textbf{700mm:} In the centre of the TPC
    \item \textbf{1400mm:} At the top of the TPC
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Geometry/csd1_geometry_black_and_white.png}
\caption{LZ geometry slice as implemented in GEANT4 from the water tank in. CSD-1 is shown along with the relevant Z-positions for calibration runs.}
\label{fig:CSD1_Geometry}
\end{figure}


\par
The \textbf{SS} cut was defined as a cluster of activity close enough together that it cannot be distinguished and can be defined in energy deposit simulations as the energy-weighted variance in position being less than the detector spatial resolution.
This was determined from the result from LUX \cite{lux_position_reconstruction_ref}, scaled to LZ as per \cite{LZ_TechnicalDesignReview_ref} to give; ${\sigma}_{z}<0.2$cm and ${\sigma}_{r}<3.0$cm.
The \textbf{FID} and skin are handled as before.
The result of the simulations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:simulated_amli_neutron_efficiency}.
\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/amli_efficiency_all_positions}

\par
Perhaps unexpectedly, the veto efficiency varies depending upon the height of the source.
Part of the reason for this is shown in Figure \ref{fig:simulated_amli_capture_time} where the time it takes for the neutron to capture in the GdLS is shown.
In high-$H$ materials, such the foam and acrylic, can effectively moderate and bound the neutron in that material.
The effect of this per volume can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:simulated_neutron_capture_time_vs_volume}.
In the capture constant this reflects itself as 2 exponential; one for a neutron that rapidly enters the GdLS and is moderated and captured there, and one for when the neutron is bouncing in a high-$H$ material before entering the GdLS.
In the latter case, the capture time constant is close to 200$\mu$s, corresponding to high-$H$ materials.
\par
Something about the ratio of the 1st and 2nd expo.
Add the fit...? to compare to data in next chapter.

\par
The efficiency for an AmLi source at 0mm is the first time the 95\% veto requirement is not met, yet it met for 1400mm despite appearing to be in geometrically similar locations.
The difference can be account for in the reduced volume of the BATs compared to TATs + YBe plug, with area below the OCV being occupied by steel legs, water and foam.
Additionally, the Skin detector volume is also smaller below the TPC.


\input{Chapters/OuterDetector/Figures/amli_neutron_capture_time}

\par
In practice any energy deposit will have to result in optical photons which are subject to the light collection efficiency (shown in Figure \ref{fig:od_lce}) for a photon to reach a PMT and the efficiency of the PMT to generate a signal (shown in Figure \ref{fig:od_pmt_qe}).
In order to determine the effect of this, full-propagation simulations were formed using the tools described in \cite{lz_simulations_ref}.
This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:simulated_amli_full_propagation_efficiency} for AmLi at 700mm. 
This position was chosen as the energy deposit efficiency was closest to that of a 1MeV neutron.
The neutron efficiency in this case never reaches the performance requirement at any energy threshold; reducing to 91\% for a 200keV threshold and 500$\mu$s window.
