abstract = {The rate of spontaneous fission decay of uranium-238 (λf238) was determined in 4π-geometry by the fission track method. Uranium glasses of known age of manufacture were used. Spontaneous tracks have accumulated since the time of manufacture and induced tracks to determine the uranium content were produced by thermal neutron irradiations. Spontaneous tracks in all glasses were found to be partially annealed. By correcting for this annealing effect, a (λf238) = 8.7 ± 0.6 × 10−17yr−1 was obtained. Uncertainty in the neutron dose is the largest source of error.}
