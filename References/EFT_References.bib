abstract = {We discuss the multipole operators that arise in treatments of semileptonic weak and electromagnetic interactions with nuclei. Tables in which exact expressions for the single-particle matrix elements of these operators in a harmonic oscillator basis are given for a wide range of oscillator shells. Together with some approximation to the one-body density matrix, these tables will allow the reader to calculate with ease cross sections for (e, e′), real photon processes, β-decay, and charged lepton capture, as well as those for many more exotic semileptonic interactions (charged and neutral current neutrino reactions, (μ, e) conversion, etc.). A specific example, elastic magnetic electron scattering from 27Al, is considered in detail.}
