We measured the \\$\\gamma\\$-ray spectra produced from the thermal neutron capture on targets comprising a natural gadolinium film and enriched \\$^\\{\\rm 155\\}\\$Gd (in Gd\\$\_\\{2\\}\\$O\\$\_\\{3\\}\\$ powder) in the energy range from 0.11 MeV to 8.0 MeV, using the ANNRI germanium spectrometer at MLF, J-PARC. The freshly analyzed data of the \\$^\\{\\rm 155\\}\\$Gd(\\$n, \\gamma\\$) reaction are used to improve our previously developed model (ANNRI-Gd model) for the \\$^\\{\\rm 157\\}\\$Gd(\\$n, \\gamma\\$) reaction [K. Hagiwara et al. [ANNRI-Gd Collaboration], Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2019, 023D01 (2019)], and its performance confirmed with the independent data from the \\$^\\{\\rm nat\\}\\$Gd(\\$n, \\gamma\\$) reaction. This article completes the development of an efficient Monte Carlo model required to simulate and analyze particle interactions involving the thermal neutron captures on gadolinium in any relevant future experiments.}",
