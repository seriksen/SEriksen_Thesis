abstract = {The dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) is a powerful tool for direct-detection experiments searching for WIMP dark matter, other dark matter models, and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Successful operation of such a TPC is critically dependent on the ability to hold high electric fields in the bulk liquid, across the liquid surface, and in the gas. Careful design and construction of the electrodes used to establish these fields is therefore required. We present the design and production of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment’s high-voltage electrodes, a set of four woven mesh wire grids. Grid design drivers are discussed, with emphasis placed on design of the electron extraction region. We follow this with a description of the grid production process and a discussion of steps taken to validate the LZ grids prior to integration into the TPC.}

Recent technological advances and relevant developments in photon detection and charge readout are discussed in the context of their applicability to those experiments.}
