Recalling an era very different from today, I describe the flow of events from the moment of inspiration through prototypes to realization as a major detector for the Positronâ€“Electron Project (PEP) at SLAC. The sense of excitement in bringing forth a genuine paradigm shift carried the collaboration forward, through struggles, victories, defeats and exhaustion, yet ultimately leading to success.}
