\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\par
It would not have been possible to get to the stage where this thesis is written without the help of numerous people.
Firstly I'd like to thank 


\par
Finally, to Ani.
Your love and support during my PhD make it possible.
I wouldn't have gotten very far without you.
